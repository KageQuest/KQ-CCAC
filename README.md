Console Commands Admin tools for use in Roblox experiences.

## Console Commands Admin Commands

Custom administrator/moderator tools that can be used by authorized players within Roblox experiences. The style and syntax of these commands are inspired by Bethesda's in-game console found in TES V: Skyrim. 

This project was co-authored by a friend of mine, known as "aaaddd" on Roblox.com. I created a majority of the commands themselves, with the notable exceptions of the "teleport" commands in which he helped with some of the CFrame math and offsets. He also was the main author of the "MainModule.lua" file; Without his help I would not have been able to figure out how to properly boot and load the majority of the functions in the commands.

PLEASE NOTE: This repo does not contain all of the required files for this project. None of these files will work without multiple other files and systems inside a Roblox experience. This repo is purely for portfolio/demonstration purposes.
